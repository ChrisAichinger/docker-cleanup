* Document rules language more formally.

* Correct error handling for IMPORT
* Add --dump <id> commandline interface for dumping DockerObjects
   - Take care to support @properties properly: Image.Name, Image.Dangling
   - Note that container.Image is an Image instance, print its Id (or str())
* More test coverage of error.py
* Add DockerDeletionError class for better error messages (differentiate
  between "no permissions to run docker" and "fail to delete container/image"
* Add test for Statement.__str__

* Add a setup.py command to automatically setup a local venv and install
  python-dateutil in it.
* Use tox as test runner (i.e. also test Python3.3)
